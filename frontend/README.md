# EVCFLO Front-End Documentation

This document was created to detail the process to set up and run the front-end react app. This is what users will see when they open the website. React was chosen for this project for the followng reasons:

- Though it has a higher learning curve, it allows more effecient website creation.
- The different areas of the website are compartmentilised, meaning changes are instantly rolled out across the whole app.
- Components can be reused, saving time
- React is fast, allowing pages to load quickly
- The file structure is logical and clean
- Scales across both desktop and mobile devices

## Setup Steps

1. Connect to the Gihub Repo and create a branch from main, name the branch after the feature you're looking to add, e.g. MarkPremier_MapComponent.
2. Create a local copy of the branch.
3. Open the terminal in the EVCFLO/frontend/evcflofront folder.
4. Type 'npm install' to install all dependencies to your local machine, this may take a minute.
5. Type 'npm start', this will build the app and launch a local server. A web browser will automatically launch with the website.
6. Any changes made to the React app will update in real time every time you save.
