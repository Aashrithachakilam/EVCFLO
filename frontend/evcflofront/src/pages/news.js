                        4. Machines to search for electric charging points available in public places 

						</h4>
						<p>
                        Because of the widespread of electric charging points , we can notice the presence of machines, these machines are used to help people to find the nearest electric chargers points to their location, which will save time and effort for people searching for electric charging points. These machines are mainly located near famous landmarks, shopping malls, places with few electric charging points, public beaches, commercial streets, parks, marketplaces, airports, hotels,etc. This led to flexibility in searching for electric charging points, and this is a very useful machine for people with electric cars visiting public places. It’s expected that these machines will be spread more especially in places where the density of people is high to cover their requirements.
